## **üïπ Direct Deployment**

1.Login to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

2.Navigate to "Workers & Pages" > "Create" and create new worker.

3.Copy the content of [worker.js](https://github.com/lawdakacoder/ContactBot/blob/main/worker.js) file.

4.Paste the code in worker's code editor and fill following variables then click deploy button:
  * **SECRET_TOKEN**: Random long url safe token to protect unauthorized execution of your Cloudflare worker.

      * Send `/secret 32` command to [DumpJsonBot](https://t.me/DumpJsonBot) to generate it.

      * Alternatively, it can be manually created by using alphabets, numbers and by not using any special character except `_` and `-`.

  * **BOT_TOKEN**: API token of your Telegram bot, can be obtained from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

  * **OWNER_IDS**: This can be obtained by sending `/chat` command to [DumpJsonBot](https://t.me/DumpJsonBot) in both personal chat and group chat.
  ```js
  const OWNER_IDS = [
    // User ids that can ban/unban users
    [
        1111111111,
        2222222222
    ],
    // Chat id where bot will send messages
    // can be group id or same as user id as
    // above. All group members can reply.
    3333333333
    ];
  ```

5.Navigate to "Workers & Pages" (drop-down menu) > "KV" > "Create a namespace" and create two namespaces called `users` and `msgs`.
